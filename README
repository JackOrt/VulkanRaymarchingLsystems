# VulkanLSystem3D

**VulkanLSystem3D** is a real-time renderer for procedurally generated 3D tree structures, using **GPU raymarching** to visualize and animate L-systems. The project features smooth growth animations between tree states and is optimized for performance using Vulkan compute shaders.

## Features

- ðŸŒ¿ **L-System-Based Trees**  
  Generate 3D plant structures from classic L-system rules.

- âœ¨ **Raymarching on the GPU**  
  Visualize tree geometry with high-fidelity shading using signed distance functions (SDFs) in compute shaders.

- ðŸŽ¬ **Animated Growth Transitions**  
  Interpolate smoothly between fully grown and partially grown states.

## Overview

This project explores the intersection of procedural modeling and modern GPU compute. L-systems are evaluated on the CPU and visualized using a custom **raymarching renderer** on the GPU, enabling seamless animations and smooth level-of-detail effects. While the system supports alternative growth structures beyond classic L-systems, the focus remains on efficient, high-quality visual output and experimental animation techniques.
